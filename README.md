<h1 style="text-align: center;">EzDNS - Change DNS Easy Pesy</h1>

EzDNS is a powershell script which makes changing DNS servers to different providers easy and convenient.

Traditionally this wasn't a convenient task. Copy pasting DNS server addresses into windows settings or control panel. And when you want to go to default, windows deletes all those values to pasted earlier.

But not now, EzDNS makes it easy to do all this. Just 2 steps! And Voila! You're done with no worries.
